# Skill Based Games Are Dying

Why do I give a fuck about this?

I think a lot of people enjoy video games. 
Some people take it more seriously than others, some people like different types of games. 
There is one genre that is always the most popular.

## Competitive Games

Counter-Strike, League of Legends, Halo, Call of Duty, Apex Legends, Rocket League, Smash Bros, Valorant.

These games are always at the top.
In viewership, player count, community, revenue and longevity.
If you want to get rich from making a video game, a completive game is your best bet.

Some people may need some convincing, especially if they have only played single player games. Think about how many people are involved though. CS:GO tournaments make a fuck ton of revenue.

Every single FPS game is competitive. People play FPS games to firstly: have fun and secondly: win.

Nobody enjoys losing, this is true for all things not just video games. I've herd people say sometimes that *they're just playing for fun*. This can be true but if your losing your not going to be saying that, if you've ever lost 16-0 in CS:GO you know what I'm talking about.

We should be trying to make games as fun as possible! Yes of course, that's not the problem. How do we make the game more fun.

Skill level is normally distributed. 
Therefore we should be catering to the average player.
This is true but I feel like there is a disconnect from what the average player is in most games.
I'll pick CS:GO as an example first because there is at least some reliable data on it.

Here is the rank distribution for CS:GO. First thing to check as a develop is which game mode is played the most. CS:GO has a few modes: Casual Modes, Competitive and Community Servers.

We can ignore Community servers because they make their own custom game modes. 
I can't say for a fact the competitive is more popular but I'm almost certain.
So we know what game mode to focus on and we know which ranks to focus on. Nova to MG seem to be the largest group of players so we should cater to them right?

Unfortunately not, Nova level players are not amazing at the game but they're okay. They *want* to get to a higher rank. They *want* to be the highest rank.

I don't know where I'm going with this.

When changing the balance of a game, what is the result your going for. You need to tell your players what you are going for.

Developer often balance their game for the lowest skilled players. This dumb for a number of reasons.
First of all, your not catering to the majority.
And secondly your going to need to lower the skill gap to do that.

How to intend to make money and your players happy when you cater to the lowest 15%.

Lowering your skill gap is diasterious because it hurts the best more than it helps the worst.
The best players are always trying to improve that's how they got there.
Removing some skilful game mechanic that a bad players don't know about won't change anything.

Let's imagine a game where no matter how long you play you can never get any better. What the fuck is the point of investing time into it? Well the game is fun that's why I play it. 

People need to understand that fun games are only fun for a while. I would extend this to single player games too.

My most played single player games are: BOTW, Witcher 3, Half-Life. Witcher 3 has a lot of content especially with it's DLC's however after playing the game through a couple times. There is nothing left after that.

Half-Life is a weird one because the game is extremely short compared the witcher 3. However i've played it almost as long. The game is super fun to speed run, and there is a lot to learn. That's why I've played it so long. The skill was the reason to play.

Progress in skill is such a great reason to keep playing, you can play a game for 1000 hours and for the first 100 it will be a completely different from your last 100.

I really need split into two sections:

The way you should balance your game

and

The way developers balance their games

It's important that I explain how to balance your game without bringing up how developers do it first. I think you should know the points I'm going to bring up before I even say them. It will be so much more effective that way.
However it's not a flamitory.

Developers need to understand that making the most money and catering to your player base goes hand in hand. They need to love you, otherwise they won't give you your money.

For example just look at steam users. Steam's service is fantastic for consumers, however developers get absolutely fucked. Steams cut is huge and as a result the prices are bad for consumers.

However sometimes the consumer will help you to fuck them if you play your cards right.
The epic games store is universally hated among all gamers. I'm probably one of the few people who doesn't have a problem with it.
The reason they hate it is not because of any legitmate reasons. They just like steam so much, that they never want to use anything else. Steam was better than it's own competition before it even existed.
They had there fans secured so early because the worked on making their platform as loved as possible.

Do this with your game. 
There was a large swap from people who played CS:GO / Fortnite to Valorant. 
They did not secure it's fanbase and got fucked because of it. 
If CS:GO and Fornite did what the people wanted, the second Valorant came out. 
Everyoen would be calling it Cheap ripoff CS:GO that includes rookit. 
Instead Valorant actually had some good features that players wanted and it was able to grow it's communtiy. 
Kill your competition before it exists.
