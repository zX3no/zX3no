**Battlefield 1**: <a name="bf1"></a>

A first person shooter without the shooter. 

- [x] Unbalanced
- [x] Casual

* Good
  * Everyone starts with a wide selection of weapons and utility
  * Highly configurable (graphics, sensitivity, HUD)
  * Guns have controllable recoil and are fairly accurate
  * Melee weapons can be used effectively
  * Wide selection of vehicles 
  * Can trample people
  * Most classes have anti-tank utility
  * You can go prone and it does conceal you (unlike PUBG)
  * Weapons feel great to shoot(tactile, well animated, good audio)
  * Planes look cool
  * The maps are visual appealing
  * Got crushed by a huge blimp
  * Can bash people to death with a shovel
  * Performance is good
  * Has sensitivity options for all zoom levels(1-10x)
* Neutral	
	* Sniper scopes glare while aimed to expose the shooter
* Bad
	* Tanks are stronger than infantry so you always feel at a disadvantage
	* Horses are extremely vulnerable and you will die quickly on  them
	* Building are destructible so there is never any cover
	* Since there is no cover tanks become even stronger
	* People are discouraged to leave their objective because there is no cover between points
	* The matches end too quickly, often at the peak of the battle
	* Player encounters are rare, which means I don't get to shoot my gun (or swing my shovel)
	* People who are prone are either too easy to see or too hard
	* Most of the gameplay consists of running from point A to B, die in the open, repeat
	* Level design is awful(too much open space, zero cover, terrible visibility)
	* The tiny window inside of tanks is annoying (it's also a worthless attempt to balance them)
	* Nobody plays the game anymore
	* There are big cannons that one hit you

**Diabotical**: <a name="diabotical"></a>

A good game, but not the unifying one we needed.


- [x] Balanced
- [x] Competitive

* Good
  * A modern interpretation of arena shooters
  * Weapons all have a unique role and nothing feels overpowered
  * The shotgun sounds good
  * Maps are interesting and balanced
  * Visually the game is consistent and clear
  * The movement is responsive and faithful to the quake genre
  * Extensive customisability (HUD, FOV, sensitivity, graphics)
  * Performance is great
* Neutral	
	* Some of the 2v2 maps are overly simplistic
	* Only one type of movement in ranked (PQL movement gives players more control however it's less popular)
	* Fans of Quake Live/Champions don't have much reason to swap
* Bad
	* There is a delay when swapping from a fast weapon to slow weapon
	* The weapon delay means that you cannot combo kill and are punished for swapping weapons
	* The plasma gun sounds pathetic
	* The melee feels unresponsive and has weird hitboxes
	* Race movement is somewhere in the middle of quake and Counter Strike. Unfortunately it is worse than both and falls short of Quake Lives PQL movement.
	* The railgun animation is unclear and can be frustrating for new players

**Planetside 2**: <a name="ps2"></a>

A good game, but not the unifying one we needed.

- [x] Balanced
- [x] Competitive


* Good
    * 3 Massive contents to fight on
	* Wide selection of weapons, all with diverse playstyles
	* Weapon damage model is mathematically calculated to match with player health. 
	
		For example: The player has 1000 HP, a weapon may do 143 damage; with 7 shots the weapon will deal 1001 damage. Therefore the weapon kills in 7 body shots.

		Other damage models:

		125 * 8 = 1000

		143 * 7 = 1001

		167 * 6 = 1002

		200 * 5 = 1000

		Notice how all of the above are as close to 1000 as possible.
	* Suit slots allow players to customise their playstyle however they like. Want more grenades? Equip Grenade Bandolier. Want to run faster? Equip Adrenaline Pump.

* Neutral	
	* Game has optional subscription which can increase the amount of currency, player buffs and vehicles you get
* Bad
	* Performance is very poor in large fights <60fps
	* Nanoweave Armor is a suit slot that *reduces income damage by 20%*. 
  		
		Most suit slots are designed to help you diversify your playstyle or increase utility. 
		
		Nanoweave essentially increases the amount of health you have, putting you at a *disadvantage* if you don't use it.

		This also completely breaks the mathematical damage model. 143 damage is turned into 114.4. Changing the bullets to kill from 7 to 9.

		Worst of all, new players may not know about this and be put at a disadvantage immediately. The developers have tried to fix this issue by equipping Nanoweave by default on some classes. This is obviously a Band-Aid solution and evidence that they don't intend to fix it.

		TODO buffing weaker items vs nerfing strong ones.
