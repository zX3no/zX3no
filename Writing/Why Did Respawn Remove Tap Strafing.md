# Why Did Respawn Remove Tap Strafing

I think we need to lay some ground work first so I'm going to make a few statements.

Aim assist in Apex is not like Fortnite. It barley gives you any advantage(so much so I don't know why it's in the game).

Tap strafing is similar to aim assist in that it barley does anything.

The skill ceiling is higher for PC players compared to console players.

If you've never played an FPS game before aiming with either a controller or mouse is difficult.

Casual players don't care about high refresh rate monitors, low ping or optimal graphics settings. Winning is not as important as having fun(for them).

Competitive players want to win and have fun doing it. Winning isn't rewarding if it wasn't fun.

You should only be as good as you are(more on this later).

## The Skill Gap

Let's imagine the skill gap looks like this:

PC

[1---------------15]

CONSOLE

[1----------10]

You both start at the same spot but the best PC players are going to be better than the best console players.
This is not to say that console players cannot be better than pc players.
There are plenty of good console players.

The question I have for you is: is this fair?

The answer is quite obviously no. It is impossible for the console player to get as good as the PC player, how do we fix this?

It's actually insanely easy. Enable Keyboard and Mouse support for Console players. Wait, wait, no! I want to play on controller! A mouse is too expensive. A good mouse and keyboard can be bought for < $50 which is cheaper than a controller!
But I want to play on the couch! That's fine but if you want to be the best you need to at the very least, sit up. Horribly unfair I know. But I have a TV and cant afford a Monitor. I'll get to this later.

Now the skill gap should look like this:

PC

[1---------------15]

CONSOLE

[1--------------14]

Wait wtf? You said It was going to be even? Here the thing about competitive video games.

Players will absolutely anything to gain an advantage. This could be: using a better input(keyboard and mouse), getting a higher refresh rate monitor(240hz), getting a better internet connection(lower ping), adjusting video setting to get better clarity.

Now you might be wondering how this is fair. And your right it's not. But what do we do about it? Another easy fix enable 120FPS mode for console players. The new Xbox and PS5 should be able to handle it.

Now our game looks like this:

PC

[1---------------15]

CONSOLE

[1---------------15]

Perfect! We've kept the skill ceiling high and allowed people to get up to it on console.
Why doesn't Respawn do this? Well...they are a more interesting approach.

I'll show you the skill gap plus the fun™ index:

PC

8.5/10 Fun

[1---------------15]

CONSOLE

7/10 Fun

[1----------10]

And after removing tap strafing:

PC

8/10 Fun

[1---------------15]

CONSOLE

7/10 Fun

[1----------10]

Heh? Nothing happened to the skill gap? The problem is that they fixed controversy not game balance.

Tap strafing exists only on PC and console players like to use it as a rebuttal to PC players complaining about aim assist.

Tap strafing and aim assist give you a small advantage. So PC players have a small advantage because of tap strafing and console players have a small advantage because of aim assist.

You might have noticed the fun index. What's that about?
I'll start by saying that fun is perceived it's not neccicarly grounded in reason.
For example Console players may have less fun because someone killed them while tap strafing. Ignoring their shit aim/terrible positioning and blaming the unbalanced game.
Same goes for a PC player who complains about aim assist.

The fun indexes would be the same if there was no crossplay. People get used to what they have, even though console players don't have tap strafing it probably wouldn't effect fun because they wouldn't be playing against it.

The problem with tap strafing being removed is that

1. It didn't change balance.
2. It reduced fun.

How could we have fixed the controvesy without reducing the fun of the game? Just add tap strafing to Console. Woah that sounds really hard.
As a '*qualified programmer*' this is bullshit. It probably took more effort to remove it than to add it.

The worst part about all of this is the president it sets. How poorly though out are some of the games other mechanics. I won't get into that now but they game has the potentially to be much more fun.

Here's the stats after my patch.

PC

8.5/10 Fun

[1---------------15]

CONSOLE

7.5/10 Fun

[1----------10]

So the game is more fun overall but console players are still not having as much fun. Here's the index after keyboard/mouse and 120hz is added. You see how PC players fun went up as well because they can stop crying about aim assist.

PC

9/10 Fun

[1---------------15]

CONSOLE

9/10 Fun

[1---------------15]

Closing notes:

I don't think aim assist should be in the game. _You are only as good as you are_.

This is something is think is really important at the highest level.
And this is why hacking is bad.
It's not because you have an advantage over another player(I have advantages over many player because I'm better at the game).
It's because they would not be as good if they computer didn't help them.

It's okay to be better than other players.
If you couldn't get better at the game, their wouldn't be much point in playing it.
However, no body want's to get killed over and over by better players. 
This is why arena shooters are not very popular. 
People are so good at them it can be hard for new players to get interested.

I'm pretty sure Apex has skill based match making for all of it's modes(at least I hope). 
This is super important otherwise new players might get frustrated and quit. 
It is important to keep in mind that experienced players spend the most money. I see streamers that have literally every skin in the game. Cater to your money makers, new players aren't spending money, regulars are.


while we're on the topic of game balance, counter play you say.
the reasons they gave were excuses.
talk about accessibility because that's actually true.

Dev plays on console.
