Current Problems:

I want to use a keystroke launcher and a display manager. However none of the available ones fit my needs.

PowerToys Run seems like a good choice

Ueli is still good because it has more options than PowerToys

I've always wanted tabs in explorer but that feature was but on hold. There is a program called [Files](https://github.com/files-community/Files) that has this but it's too slow to use.

I also need a cli timer

I have mixed feeling about my cli task manger, most of them are only avaliable on windows. I'm not sure what I want yet.

Keystroke Launchers:

[Ueli:](https://github.com/oliverschwendener/ueli)

No plugin support.

Does not have Acylic blur and program icons look weird.

Looks okay

[Khanhas/Ueli:](https://github.com/khanhas/ueli)

Has blur and looks much better than standard ueli.

Has program switcher.

No program icons.

No longer being worked on.

Configuration is limited compared to the newer version

[Keypirinha, Zazu:]()

Looks horrible

Worse than Ueli

[Wox:](https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox)

Has plugin manager

Has not been updated for over a year.

Looks bad.


[PowerToys Run:](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys)

Comes with powertoys, something I already use.

Has good icons

Has program switcher

Limited plugins

No visual configuration

Looks okay

Should have a lot of the features I want when [1.0 is released](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/milestone/8)

[Cerebro:](https://github.com/cerebroapp/cerebro)

Lots of plugins

Looks meh

Different design to the rest

---

Display Managers:

[Fancytiling:](https://github.com/khanhas/fancytiling)

Broken and outdated.

[PowerToys Fancy Tiles:](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys)

What I currently use. 

Not really a tiling manger, however it's better than windows native implementation.

[bug.n:](https://github.com/fuhsjr00/bug.n)

Looks terrible

[workspacer:](https://github.com/rickbutton/workspacer)

Works out of the box

top bar looks terrible and is not configurable

[nog:](https://github.com/TimUntersberger/nog)

active development

top bar looks okay

breaks windows sometimes

[b3:](https://github.com/ritschmaster/b3)

crashes on launch
