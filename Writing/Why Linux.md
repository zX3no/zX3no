### Why linux 

I often see people shitting on Microsoft and I'm always cursious as to why.
I stumbled across a post on reddit that said "*I feel like software is slowly becoming more focused in aesthetic design than usefulness*".

This is not the first time I've heard this actually. Many of the complaints about Windows 11 were that it focused on a UI overhaul rather than any functional improvements. 
It's odd because I think the most request feature was to move to a more modern design. Appealing to your customers aside. I think people often overstate how functional *older* software was.

Heres a funny comment: 

*I fucking love old office 2007's look. I now use office 365, and i hate it's look , I feel like there are so many features missing, but they're just more hidden to give it a more aesthetic look*

For those who don't know office 2007 is the Windows Vista version of word. I think it was the one that introduced the ribbon design. The ribbon was designed to segment functionally into different categories. The modern version is not much different, however. Microsoft has done a better job at putting the more useful options plain sight, and hiding the less useful ones. 

Design and functionally go hand in hand and it's weird to see people complaining about it because they cannot get used to it. 

Stuborness slows down software devlopment. There are many people who refuse to redesign something, even if there are objective benifits, just because they're used to it. Vim for example is something is drastically in need of a redesign. Vi was not designed for modern keyboards, so some of the bindings(Escape) do not make sense. 

Here some things I like about linux:
- Tiling window mangers
- Custom status bars 
- File lauchers
- Desktop enviroment 
- Custom compositors.
- Easy startup scripts
- Lot's of CLI Apps
- Can play games
- Soon to get anti-cheat support

Linux is quite configurable and has a large ecosystem of programs. 
Why do I use windows then?

- Despite all of it's configuration there is no way to make GTK programs look good.

    GTK was not designed to be pretty, that's not what linux is about...right?
    Most desktop environments on linux look old(except for KDE), they are extremely simple almost placeholder looking UI's. GTK was designed in a similar way.
    It's sort of like the old windows control panel style UI's. Windows has moved on twice from this. However linux has not. Despite all of it's configuration, linux at is core is not meant to be pretty. 

    GTK looks very old, this can be fixed. Hope is not lost, however for now, Microsoft and Apple both steal the show.

    And it shows given they are 100x more popular.

- I'm a developer, I want to write software that is fast, functional and beautiful. 

    It's not that I cannot do all of these things on Linux. It's that I can't do them any better on Linux. 

    Windows is the most popular platform and if I want to right good software for the majority of users. Writing and testing on Windows means that I will work for the majority of your users.

- The culture

    Windows doesn't really have a culture, however Linux does.

    Linux users are often quite a lot older and with age comes stubbornness. 
    I also see a lot of *philosophies*. The unix philosophy, the handmade philosophy, the suckless philosophy.
    These are quite concerning because people will blindly follow guidelines without questioning why it's a good idea.

    I find that almost everyone on linux uses C. C is old so it makes sense, but I don't like the way any modern language is instantly discredited for whatever reason. 
    C is slow to write and has poor error handling, why people still defend the use of the language is absurd to me. Sometimes when dealing with old code you need to use C. This is fine, but using it for new projects?

- Functionally 

    A lot of linux tools are extremely complicated to use. The coreutils for example, require so much knowledge just to use a simple command. 
    Most of the things in windows can be done with a GUI. People often say that a terminal is faster, and it is for somethings. Most of the time the terminal is good at repeating tasks you already know how to do, quickly. A GUI is supposed to allow to do something without looking at a manual. Linux has such an empisis on CLI tools that it sometimes becomes absurd to do something simple.
