## Current Projects:
*  [MPD and ncmpcpp on windows with WSL.](https://github.com/zX3no/ncmpcppOnWindows)
     Tutorial on how to configure MPD and ncmpcpp to work on windows with wsl.

     ![](https://github.com/zX3no/zX3no/blob/main/Images/ncmpcpp.png?raw=true)

*  [Repository Setup Reference.](https://github.com/zX3no/zX3no/blob/main/Writing/Repo%20Setup.md)
     I make a lot of GitHub repositories and I often need to look up something during the setup. A reference/guide makes my life a lot easier. I also have a script I use to make commits and push them automatically. I definitely change this though. 

* [FPS List.](https://github.com/zX3no/zX3no/blob/main/Writing/FPS%20List.md)
    Analysis of first-person shooter games. Important for the game I'm working on.

*  [Yaw List.](https://github.com/zX3no/zX3no/blob/main/Writing/Yaw%20List.md)
     A list of yaw values used in video games. Currently websites like www.mouse-sensitivity.com offer this but the values are not public. Some of the features are also payed.

* I removed the section on my Game Development work since it's something that I'm always working on. I don't like having out of date writing. It's happening one day though, **trust me**.

*  I have a collection of config files for various programs on this repo. I will be used for automating my windows install since it breaks so often. See: [PythonAutomaticInstaller](https://github.com/zX3no/PythonAutomaticInstaller). 

    Project is scraped because [subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html) is no fun and web scraping is not the way to do it. I will probably move it into powershell, now that [choco](https://chocolatey.org/) is a thing. I have a list of programs I use on Google Sheets which I'll move over here at some  point.

* I have a repository on GitLab with all of my VST's and VST installers. GitHub has a 2GB limit so I can't use it. They also sent me some *mean* emails about the amount of data I'm using. 

    Managing plugins is frustrating and It's no fun re-installing everything to make music. I'm yet to find a good system since I'm not a fan of symbolic-links (at least not for *everything*).

To Do List:
* Automate program installation and configurations
* Setup Oh my Posh
* Write windows config document
* Simplify reinstall for mpd and ncmpcpp | maybe a script for this
* Find better remote shutdown solution, going to a website is a bit annoying. I want google home intergration.
* Add proper shortcuts to windows terminal. ctrl+w for close, ctrl+num for switching 
* Script that monitors my windows version and emails me the patch notes of whatever update windows just forced on me
* Figure out the crop playlist bug in ncmpcpp
* automatic replay gain scanning, idk if it's possible
* add copy directory to clipboard to context menu
* Get a better To Do list
