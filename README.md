  A simple task manager, written in rust.

- [MPD Hotkeys](https://github.com/zX3no/MPDHotkeys)

  Global Hotkeys for mpd.

- [Repository Setup Reference](https://github.com/zX3no/zX3no/blob/main/Writing/Repo%20Setup.md)

  I make a lot of GitHub repositories and I often need to look up something during the setup. A reference/guide makes my life a lot easier. I also have a script I use to make commits and push them automatically. I definitely change this though.

- [FPS List](https://github.com/zX3no/zX3no/blob/main/Writing/FPS%20List.md)

  Analysis of first-person shooter games.

- [Yaw List](https://github.com/zX3no/zX3no/blob/main/Writing/Yaw%20List.md)

  A list of yaw values used in video games. Currently websites like www.mouse-sensitivity.com offer this but the values are not public. Some of the features are also payed.

- [Rick Click Registry](https://github.com/zX3no/RightClickRegistry)

  A collection of registry tweaks to remove things from the right click menu.

- [Sheet Music](https://github.com/zX3no/SheetMusic)

  A collection of sheet music, scores and midi files.

- [WeaponScript](https://github.com/zX3no/WeaponScript)

  A script for [Areate](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=823181241). It allows players to equip weapons using chat commands(including knives). I may write some information on settings this up, but squirrel is a horrible language and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. 

- [Windows Config.](https://github.com/zX3no/zX3no/blob/main/Writing/Windows%20Config.md) 

  Instructions to install all my programs / configuration files. I might write a tutorial at some point about how you can setup your own. Hopefully some of that will be self evident.

- I have a repository on GitLab with all of my VST's and VST installers. GitHub has a 2GB limit so I can't use it. They also sent me some _mean_ emails about the amount of data I'm using.

  Managing plugins is frustrating and It's no fun re-installing everything to make music. I'm yet to find a good system since I'm not a fan of symbolic-links (at least not for _everything_).

  Unfortunately because of copyright I can make the repository public. However it's on my todo list to write about my findings. 

- I removed the section on my Game Development work since it's something that I'm always working on. I don't like having out of date writing. It's happening one day though, **trust me**.
