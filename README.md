  A script for [Areate](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=823181241). It allows players to equip weapons using chat commands(including knives). I may write some information on settings this up, but squirrel is a horrible language and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

  A few pieces of writing about various topics.
