# Current Projects:

* ## [FPS List](https://github.com/zX3no/zX3no/blob/main/Writing/FPS%20List.md)
    ### Analysis of first-person shooter games. Important for the game I'm working on.
* ## [Yaw List](https://github.com/zX3no/zX3no/blob/main/Writing/Yaw%20List.md)
    ### A list of yaw values used in video games. Currently websites like www.mouse-sensitivity.com offer this but the values are not public. Some of the features are also payed.
* ## [Config](https://github.com/zX3no/zX3no/tree/main/Config)
    ### A collect of config files for various programs. Will be used for automating my windows install since it breaks so often. See: [PythonAutomaticInstaller](https://github.com/zX3no/PythonAutomaticInstaller). Project is *on hold* because of the limitations of [subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html).
* ## Unnamed Game
    ### In early stages, over the past year I've used Unreal Engine and Unity. Both of which have given me trouble, however Unity seems to be the better choice. I *could* work on my own engine however  that would be a waste of time, I'm better off working around the issues.
    ### Current Goals
    * ### UDP Client/Server Networking Model
    * ### Weapon Models
    * ### [Source like movement system](https://github.com/zX3no/UnityScripts)
    * ### In-game console
* ## Repository Setup Reference
    ### I make a lot of GitHub repositories and I often need to look up something during the setup. A reference/guide makes my life a lot easier.
