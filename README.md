Needs management:

zX3no:

Needs some color, italics, bold text. Anything that will make it look better than just text.

block:

Terrible name, not centered, flickers on linux, not very useful.

timer:

Flickers, crashes without arguments, arguments barely work

rindexer:

Needs a rename, need to integrate egui.

MPDHotkeys:

It's not very reliable. Should probably add a config to the rust version and delete it.

Unity Scripts:

Don't use unity any more should delete

Weapon Script:

Needs rename and a push to the workshop

Repo Setup, * List:

I need a blog or something to put things like this. Might be a good way to learn react or vue.

t:

Add option for deadlines and date
