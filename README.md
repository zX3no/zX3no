# Current Projects:

* ## [FPS List](https://github.com/zX3no/zX3no/blob/main/Writing/FPS%20List.md)
    ### Analysis of first-person shooter games. Important for the game I'm working on.
* ## [Yaw List](https://github.com/zX3no/zX3no/blob/main/Writing/Yaw%20List.md)
    ### A list of yaw values used in video games. Currently websites like `www.mouse-sensitivity.com` offer this but the values are not public. Some of the features are also payed.
* ## [Config](https://github.com/zX3no/zX3no/tree/main/Config)
    ### A collect of config files for various programs. Will be used for automating my windows install since it breaks so often. See: [PythonAutomaticInstaller](https://github.com/zX3no/PythonAutomaticInstaller). Project is *on hold* because of the limitations of [subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html).
